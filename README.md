# Bank-Customer-Complaint-Analysis
This is a project my group and I made for the Aptitude AI PreInternship Program at Citi. We utilized Python's data science and machine learning libraries to make an NLP model that could analyze a complaint made by a customer and group it based off the complaint.
# Results
This is the confusion matrix my group got when we tested our model. The accuracy was relatively low but could be improved if we lowered the amount of groups
